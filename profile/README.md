Our featured public repository are:

### ml-mr
[ml-mr](https://github.com/pgx-ml-lab/ml-mr) is a package that implements machine learning based instrumental variable estimators. It includes the implementation of [Quantile IV](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(25)00171-5) which was published in the AJHG (2025).

### Workshop on Statistical Genetics and Genetic Epidemiology STAGE-Quebec

We contributed to the 2025 edition of the [STAGE-Quebec training workshop](https://www.crmath.ca/en/activities/#/type/activity/id/4039) where we presented a section on TWAS analyses. The materials developed in the context of this workshop are available [here](https://github.com/pgx-ml-lab/2025-STAGE-workshop-TWAS).

We plan on open-sourcing bioinformatics and AI tools tu support the development of a precision pharmacotherapy on this Github page.
